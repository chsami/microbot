/**
 * The Category enum represents different categories of player activities, such as combat, skilling, and processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each category is associated with a specific type of activity and contains logic to determine whether the player is "busy"
 * based on the current game state. This is used to control bot behavior and ensure it adapts to the player's activity,
 * pausing or adjusting actions when the player is engaged in a task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Main Features:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Categories for Various Activities: Includes categories such as combat, skilling (e.g., fishing, cooking, magic),
 *   processing, and collecting, each with its own logic to determine if the player is busy.</li>
 *   <li>Custom Busy Logic: Each category overrides the <code>isBusy()</code> method, providing custom logic
 *   for determining if the player is engaged in the respective activity.</li>
 *   <li>Bot Activity Control: The bot uses these categories to manage when it should take action or pause, based
 *   on whether the player is currently busy performing an activity.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage:</h3>
 * <p>
 * The <code>Category</code> enum is used within the bot's logic to monitor the player's activities and determine
 * if the bot should continue executing actions or wait for the player to finish their current task. Each category
 * provides specific logic to handle different types of activities such as combat, skilling, and crafting.
 * This class is used by the anti-ban system to make sure the action cooldown is not counting down while the player is busy.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Example:</h3>
 * <pre>
 * Category currentCategory = Category.SKILLING_COOKING;
 * if (currentCategory.isBusy()) {
 *     // The player is busy cooking, so the bot may pause actions.
 * } else {
 *     // The player is idle, and the bot can continue with the next task.
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Customization:</h3>
 * <p>
 * Each category overrides the <code>isBusy()</code> method to implement custom logic for checking if the player is engaged
 * in a specific task. For example, the <code>COMBAT_MID</code> category checks if the player is in combat, while the
 * <code>SKILLING_COOKING</code> category checks if the player is currently cooking. Some categories are not fully implemented
 * and include TODO notes for further customization based on game-specific conditions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Development Notes:</h3>
 * <p>
 * Several categories contain TODO notes indicating that additional logic may be required to accurately determine if the player is busy.
 * These categories currently rely on simple checks, such as whether the player is animating or if the inventory is full,
 * but may need further refinement based on specific interactions or game mechanics.
 * </p>
